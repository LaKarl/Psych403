The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a psychological measure that is used to assess the strength of an individual's automatic association between mental representations of objects in memory. The task typically consists of sorting words or images into categories as quickly as possible. The IAT has been widely used to study unconscious biases and stereotypes and has helped researchers understand the ways in which these biases can influence behavior.

This Experiment has 2 blocks of 10 trials. On each trial, after being shown an image of a word, the participant will have time to click the right or left arrow key depending on what category they think the word is categorized under. This experiment waits for the participant to press one of the option before beginning the next trial.For each trial, the block number, trial number, participant answer, and reaction time is stored. 

After all trials are complete, the data form the information is saved as a .csv file in the directory that is chosen.
