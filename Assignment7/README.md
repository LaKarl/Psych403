## Wait Exercise

1. See [WaitExercise]() here.


## Clock Exercise
1. See []() here.
The wait timer was fairly accurate as the time was only decimals a way each trial. For instance, the numbers I got were, 2.0005681000184268, 2.0007286030184366, 2.000640399986878. So, it is not 100% accurate, but gets the job done.

2. See []() here.
The wait timer is less accurate than in clock exercise 1. For instane, the numbers I got were, 2.0095846001058817, 2.0007066999096423, 2.0014476000797004.
