## Answers for Monitor and window Exercises
1. Psychopy lets the user use a variety of units like height, deg, pix, cm, etc. The user has to make a decision based on their devices, software, etc. In our case, changing the size of the unit will influence the size of the window we are using in our experiments. For demos and experiments, the units we may be using the most is potentially 'norm', 'height', and 'cm'

2. Psychopy uses 3 color spaces, RGB, DKL, and LMS. Using colorSpace allows you to change the color of your window. Yes, we can define each color by name. This is done through strings and using the hexvalue of the color.
