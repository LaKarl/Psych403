## Wait Exercise

1. See [WaitExercise](https://github.com/LaKarl/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/waitexercise.py) here.


## Clock Exercise
1. See [clockexercise1](https://github.com/LaKarl/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/clockexercise1.py) here.
The wait timer was fairly accurate as the time was only decimals a way each trial. For instance, the numbers I got were, 2.0005681000184268, 2.0007286030184366, 2.000640399986878. So, it is not 100% accurate, but gets the job done.

2. See [clockexercise2](https://github.com/LaKarl/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/clockexercise2.py) here.
The wait timer is less accurate than in clock exercise 1. For instane, the numbers I got were, 2.0095846001058817, 2.0007066999096423, 2.0014476000797004.

3. See [clockexercise3](https://github.com/LaKarl/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/clockexercise3.py) here. The countdown timer is less accurate than using core.wait. FOr instance, the numbers I got were, 2.0050985240417039, 2.000451662964962, 2.0009129162944672.
